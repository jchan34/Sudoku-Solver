# Sudoku-Solver
Classic Sudoku Solver with a GUI implementation

The Sudoku solver and graphical game is independent of each other. 
To set up the game you need to create a board layout in Graphical.py and run it. Then to input entries in white spaces, you click on the box, hit the number and hit enter to submit. The program allows you to submit "illegal" entries i.e. enter two 1's in a row. The solver itself will output the solved puzzle and the game should stop when you have that same layout.

Minor fixes incoming!
